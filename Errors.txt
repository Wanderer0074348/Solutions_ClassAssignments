Important things to look out for:
  #include<stdio.h>
  int main()
  {
    int i =0;
    for (i)
    {
      printf("Hello");
    }
  }
       What is wrong in the code?
       1. for requires (;;) two semi colons in the code, which is not present
       2. for(i;;) causes an infinite loop
  
  
  this for loop will execute till condition is met
    for(i=0;i<3;i++);
   
  this loop will run infinite times
    for(;;)
  
  printf first puts the output to the compiler then returns the number of characters 
  
  Unary minus operator is used twice. same maths rules apply, (minus*minus = positive)
  ie. int c = - -3; ==> c = 3;
